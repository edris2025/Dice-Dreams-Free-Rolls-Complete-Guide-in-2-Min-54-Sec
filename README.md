#### 1. **Roll Smart**
In *Dice Dreams*, your rolls determine the outcome of various actions, such as opening chests, completing quests, or gaining resources for your city. You want to use your rolls strategically.

#### 4. **Save Rolls for Big Rewards**
Sometimes, it’s worth saving up your free rolls for a larger goal. For example, if there’s a treasure chest or event that requires multiple rolls to unlock, it can be beneficial to stockpile rolls and use them in bulk. This will give you a better chance of hitting bigger rewards or items that can help you progress faster.

### Additional Tips for Maximizing Your Free Rolls

While free rolls are a great way to progress, here are some additional strategies to keep in mind when playing *Dice Dreams*:
